# Functional Trainer (Patched)

Mobile-first adaptive functional training app (PWA-ready scaffold).
Designed for Cloudflare Pages (frontend) + Cloudflare Workers (API).

## Cloudflare Pages setup
- Build command: `npm run build`
- Output directory: `dist`
- Root directory: repo root

## Notes
- `workers/wrangler.toml` is for Worker deployment (kept out of Pages config).
